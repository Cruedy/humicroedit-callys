We followed the instructions from the paper's code respository from 2020. This involved downloading the dataset, creating a folder for our outputs, and running the baseline for sub task 1 and sub task 2. For both sub tasks, we wanted the ouputs to match the outputs in the given output_dev_baseline folder. This worked successfully for sub task 1. For sub task 2, we edited baseline_task_2.py to get the index of the maximum count of labels. This required changing the technique to get the index from np.argmax() to idxmax().
